A colorful, dark color scheme, inspired by ir_black (http://blog.infinitered.com/entries/show/6) and twilight (vimscript #1677).

Designed primarily for a graphical Vim, but includes support for 256, 88, 16, and 8 color terminals. On a 16 or 8 color terminal, replace its colors with these for best results: https://raw.github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim/master/ansi-term-colors.txt

If you cant change your terminals colors, set g:jellybeans_use_lowcolor_black to zero in your .vimrc to render black text as grey.
